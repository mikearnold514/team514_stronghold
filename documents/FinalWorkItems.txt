Programmers Task List.

High Level Objectives:
1. Ready the robot for competition
- Complete changes needed to TeleOp
- Define all Autonomous Modes
- Code all Autonomous Modes
- Build test OI Buttons to test isolated functionality.


1. Complete changes needed for TeleOp
- Complete - Remove unused Commands - MagForward, MagRevers, AutoCMD1 (leave this is OI class, just comment out.  It will be our test button).
- Complete - Rename DriveCourtyard to just DriveEncoder, pass in a parameter that is the distance to drive.
- Complete - Remove DriveOuterworks, not needed.
- Complete - Add commands to help autonomous coding:
- Complete -- ArmOut
- Complete -- ArmBack
- Complete -- Pivot - the robot will not only need to drive straight but it will need to pivot based on Gyro feedback, so we can shoot in autonomous.
- Complete - ArmUtil changes (we will mock up the Pot values, and map them to RobotMap.  We will calibrate all this on Thursday and Hofstra).
- Complete -- Add Potentiometer - Hold off on this!
- Complete -- Add Encoder - Ben found the cable connector and we can use the Mag Encoder.
- Complete -- Add Limit Switches
- Complete -- Code in the Encoder (not Pot) and Switches to control motor operation within the Util class.
- Robot.java
-- Add driveUtil.calibrateGyro() to robotInit() method
-- Get CameraServer working and ensure code is ready for cameras (USB, Axis) - Validate roboRIO config in browser!

2. Define all Autonomous Modes
- I have gone thru this and I have defined 11 different modes that we could/should support.
- We can review these tonight and come to agreement.
- Once we have agreement it is a matter of coding each Command/CommandGroup and adding to the SendableChooser() in Robot.java.  Oh and testing each on our autoCMD1 test button!

Thanks!
